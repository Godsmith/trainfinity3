# Event bus for distant nodes to communicate using signals.

## Emitted when track reservations are updated, e.g. when track is reserved or
## unreserved by a train, but also when track is created or deleted.
## [br]If the signal is emitted by a train, the train is provided in the [by_train] 
## parameter. This is useful so that a train does not react to itself, for example.
